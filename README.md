<h2> Hi, myself Ratnakar Sahoo </a> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRqMxBADwpK2a6Q/giphy.gif" width="30"></h2>
  <p> I am a UG student from National Institute of Technology Rourkela, pursuing B.Tech in Chemical Engineering.
  I am a tech enthusiast and passionate about coding and designing. I love to learn new things. I will persue my passion in programming with dedication and hard work.

  Learning is the best part of being a child. As it gives you enormous amount of time to invest in yourselves.
 <br>The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.</p>
